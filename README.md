Thanks for checking out our project!

This code is for parsing a gmail inbox and finding emails from Facebook that contain certain keywords. 

If an email is found that contains one of those keywords, some additional information is extracted from Facebook email and a new "notification" email is sent.

The gmail.py file is the where most of the action occurs. Then there are methods in emailSender2 and emailReader files do the email parsing and email sending.
